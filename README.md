# Problems
## List01

  You will be given a list of fruits. Add x fruit to it from the end and return.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana"];  x = 'kiwi'
Output: ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(fruits) <= 10^5

## List02

  You will be given a list of fruits. Add the x fruit to the i index and return it.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana"] x = 'kiwi' i=1
Output: ["apple", "kiwi", "banana"]

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(fruits) <= 10^5
  - 0 <= i < length(fruits)

## List03

  You will be given a list of several fruits called fruits1 and fruits2. Return the result by adding the second to the first list.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: fruits1 = ["apple", "banana"] fruits2 = ["kiwi", "pear"]
Output: ["apple", "banana", "kiwi", "pear"]

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(fruits1) <= 10^5
  - 1 <= length(fruits2) <= 10^5

## List04

  You are given a list of numbers. i Delete and return the number in the index.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] i = 2
Output: 3

```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: numbers = [4, 7, 3, 2, 8] i = 4
Output: 8

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(numbers) <= 10^5
  - 0 <= i < length(numbers)

## List05

  You are given a list called numbers1 and numbers2.
  Merge the first list into the second and return.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: numbers1 = [6, 8, 1] numbers2 = [3, 5, 7]
Output: [6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7]

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(numbers1) <= 10^5
  - 1 <= length(numbers2) <= 10^5

## List06

  Given a list called Fruits, it contains at least one apple. Find how many apples are on the list and return.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "pear"]
Output: 2

```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "apple", "apple]
Output: 4

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(fruits) <= 10^5

## List07

  A list of zeros and ones is given. Find how many zeros are involved and return.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: list1 = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
Output: 2

```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: fruits = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: 7

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(list1) <= 10^5

## List08

  A list called "fruits" is given  contains at least one "apple". Remove the apples from the list and return the list.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "pear", "apple"]
Output: ["banana", "pear"]

```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "apple", "apple", "apple", "kiwi"]
Output: ["kiwi"]

```

**Constraints:**

  - length(fruits) == 5

## List09

  A list called “fruits” is given  and contains at least one “apple”. Calculate how many “apple” were involved and return the indexes in a list view.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "pear", "apple"]
Output: [3, 0, 2, 4]

```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "apple", "apple", "apple", "kiwi"]
Output: [4, 0, 1, 2, 3]

```

**Constraints:**

  - length(fruits) == 5

## List10

  A list of zeros and ones is given. Find how many ones and how many zeros there are and return to the list form.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: list1 = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
Output: [3, 5]

```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: list1 = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
Output: [4, 7]

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(list1) <= 10^5
